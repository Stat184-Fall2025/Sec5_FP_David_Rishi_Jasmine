# Introduction

The focus of our group project is to look into how Apple's supplier companies stock performances affect Apple's stock. We decided to look at 4 of Apple's main suppliers: Foxconn, Pegatron, Compal, and TSMC. All of these companies are based in Taiwan, and they also supply other companies with microchips and other parts. Our goal is to see whether or not there is a relationship between these stocks and Apple's, in order to see if we can use that to predict if Apple's stock performance will go up or down.

## The Dataset

We got the data for our project from the tidyquant R package. The tidyquant package is used to retrieve data about the stock market from the web (more specifically, Yahoo Finance). Using this package we decided to pull stock information about the 5 companies we're analyzing from 2022 to the present.

### FAIR and CARE Principles

The data that we pulled from the tidyquant package follows both the FAIR and CARE principles. The FAIR principles state that data must be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable; while the CARE principles emphasis that data should provide collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics.

I need to find my notes from this day, so I'll add more to this section later.

## Methods

This section will explain the normalization and cumulative growth.

### Normalized Performance Line Chart

The normalized line chart shows how Apple and its suppliers' stocks have performed since their starting values in 2022.

TSMC (TSM) had the greatest overall growth, and had a steep upward trend that began in 2024. However, TSMC also had the worst normalized stock performance from 2022 until 2024. This suggest that TSMC was likely hit the hardest of the suppliers by COVID-19, and it's strong performance came as a result from increased demand for semiconductors and its role in the current AI boom.

Foxconn (HNHPF) also demonstrates significant growth from 2024 and onward. It's percent change is very close to TSMC and it's stock didn't drop as much as TSMC from 2022 to 2024. This is likely due to Foxconn being Apple's main supplier for assembly.

Pegatron (4938.TW) and Compal (2324.TW) had moderate growth, which then dipped in 2025. This suggests that they have a slower recovery compared to TSMC and Foxconn and are likely not involved with AI.

Apple (AAPL) remains relatively stable and has had a decent upward trend. It's much less volatile than its suppliers, which is likely due to its presence in multiple markets and that Apple is an established company.

The difference in stock performance shows that supplier stocks can outperform Apple's stock in relative terms, especially in growth phases. Currently, AI is being heavily invested in and supplier companies that produce things for AI can experience a lot of growth. TSMC and Foxconn are the most dynamic of the supplier stocks, and can offer predictive insight for Apple's performance.

       y = "Percent Change",

  theme_minimal()
```

### Normalized Apple and Foxconn Stock Performance

Looking at the previous graph, we concluded that both Foxconn and TSMC could have predictive value for Apple. We decided to look into the relationship between Foxconn and Apple since Foxconn is a larger supplier to Apple than TSMC.

Foxconn is more volatile than Apple, and starting in early 2024 has much sharper swings in percent change. At this time, its percent change also surpasses Apple's. Despite having a lower stock price, Foxconn has stronger relative growth.

The difference in volatility between Apple and Foxconn indicates that Foxconn is more sensitive to demand and supply chain pressures. Foxconn's performance can potentially change before Apple's. Foxconn trended upwards before Apple followed suit in both early 2024 and 2025, which supports the idea that supplier stocks can be leading indicators in performance. However, Apple's steadiness and modest fluctuations also implies that supplier volatility doesn't always directly translate into Apple's performance.

ggplot(normalized_data_small, aes(x = date, y = percent_change, color = symbol)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = .5) +

       x = "Date",
       y = "Percent Change",
       color = "Stock") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

### Annual Growth Line Plot

This visualization shows how Apple's stock performance compares with it's suppliers every year. We plotted cumulative returns for each company, and reset their performance to 0% at the start of each year. This way, we can look at how each stock changes across different market conditions.

In 2022, none of the stocks performed particularly well. Cumulative returns ranged from around 0% to -40% at the end of the year.

2023 is when most of the companies started recovering and experiencing strong growth. Compal had the most growth, with cumulative returns at the end of the year reaching 80%. Foxconn, however, remained flat this year despite Apple's surge. This suggests that not all of the suppliers immediately respond to Apple's growth.

Unlike in 2023, Foxconn had a dramatic rise in 2024, which peaked around 120% in the middle of the year before it stabilized. This likely reflects either an increase in production or a shift in its operations. In 2024, TSMC also continued its upward growth from the previous year while Apple, Compal, and Pegatron's growth remained more flat and stable.

In 2025, both Compal and Pegatron's performance dipped and they are both ending the year with a cumulative return of around -20%. Apple maintained a mild and steady growth, while TSMC and Foxconn experienced stronger growth (despite a dip earlier in the year).

By looking at these plots, we can see that TSMC consistently tracks Apple's performance while also often having stronger returns. Foxconn's growth was more delayed than TSMC's but still managed to have strong growth in 2024 and 2025, which suggests that it responds to Apple's demand cycles more slowly (which could offer predictive value). Pegatron and Compal's performances are less aligned with Apple, which indicates that they have less influence on Apple's stock or are less responsive.

  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

print(line_plot) # This will result in the line plot for every year.
```

### Annual Returns Bar Chart

The bar chart below summarizes the total annual return for Apple and its four main suppliers from 2022 to the present.  Each bar represents the percent change in __ from the beginning to the end of the year.

2022 was a difficult year for every company, which correlates to how the tech market was still recovering from the effects of COVID-19.  2023 was when the Apple and its supplier companies started to rebound.  Compal and Apple had the strongest performance.  In 2024, growth slowed for Pegatron and Compal while Apple maintained solid growth.  TSMC and Foxconn surged, likely due to increased demand or changes in operations.  During 2025, Apple and its two main suppliers still grew, but at a more modest rate.  Pegatron and Compal declined, likely due to a lack of demand and a lull in sales for non-AI technology.

# Discussion

## Relationship Between Apple and Suppliers

Apple's stock performance isn't perfectly correlated with the suppliers. While suppliers do provide Apple with necessary components for manufacturing their products, their stock movements also depend on the broader semiconductor and electronics market.

## Predictive Value

Supplier stocks can provide early indicators of Apple's stock performance, especially the larger companies that have greater revenues. However, product launches, global demand, and brand perceptions also play a large role in Apples performance.

## Limitations

The data that we collected is limited from 2022 to the present, so it may not catch long-term patterns and cycles. Supplier stocks can also be influenced by clients other than Apple, so they aren't always reliable.

"I normalized the data b/c APPL stock price is over 100 and HNHPF is less than 10,

In other words HNHPF will look like a flat line even when APPL in visually moving up and down."
